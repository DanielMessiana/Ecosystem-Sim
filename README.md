"# Ecosystem-Sim" 

This project simulates rabbits and foxes. The idea is that the rabbits have attributes, like speed for instance. This speed will pass on to other rabbits as genes and hopefully improve over time. 

Also I just want to simulate an ecosystem. I think natural selection is cool. I hope to add a neural network to this project.
